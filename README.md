# boom-box

```
npm install
npm run build // builds css from components
```

start a BeakerBrowser project pointing at this folder

Check it out in beaker, add the URI of a DAT folder with music in it that you're already seeding. ENJOY

**NOTE** you need to re-run `npm run build` any time you change the css. I might yet work on updating the dev setup to auto-build the css. (see nodemon, npm-watch)
